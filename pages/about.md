## About the Collection

This is a demo collection, helping me learn to use CollectionBuilder through GitHub. I intend to:  

- Use Markdown
- Use GitHub web UI

## Test Header

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
